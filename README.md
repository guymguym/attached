## Share beautiful attachments

Mix a page with youtube videos, images, animated gifs, and glue it together with your words.
To share click on the "finish edit" button on top-left corner, which will copy the link (long one) to your clipboard.
Move, resize, change colors, and choose wallpapers to make it beautiful (undo/redo using back/forward of browser).

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to make it easy and fast for people to create beautiful pages from existing web content.
For example can be used to make memes on top of images or youtube videos.

## Everything is in the url

The entire design of the page is encoded in the url hash part and doesn't even reach the server.
The url gets long, but can be shortened using popular shortening sites, or just sent using email or other social tools.
